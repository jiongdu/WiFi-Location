**About**

wificap is a tiny tool to get the wifi data from STA like rssi, macaddr, frequency in linux platform or Openwrt. These data are captured by wireless network adapter in AP and stored in server.     
Based on these data, we have designed an improved algorithm based on traditional triangulation algorithm and the code implemention has been uploaded. By the way, some code relevant to the running environment should be changed accordingly when testing the algorithm in practice.

Next, we will put the theory of the algorithm on the blog in detail and continue to seek for the method to improve the positioning accuracy.
